the watchdog manager has three supervision mechanisms:

alive supervision checks if a supervised entiity is run not too frequently or
  not too rarely.

deadline supervision checks if some steps in a supervised entity take a time
  that is within the configured minimum and maximum.

logical supervision fundamental technique for checking the correct execution of
  embedded system software.  focuses on control flow errors, which cause a
  divergence from the valid program sequence during the error-free execution of
  the application.
  incorrect control flow occurs if one or more program instructions are
  processed either in the incorrect sequence or not at all.


watchdog manager may need to use supervised entities and checkpoints within watchdog
manager itself, while avoiding recursion.

if detecting a supervision failure which is located in a non-trusted partition,
the watchdog manager may request a partition shutdown by calling the BswM.

in case an immediate, global reaction to the supervision failure is necessary,
the watchdog manager may directly cause an MCU reset.
MCU reset and watchdog reset are two mostly equivalent mechanisms for
system-level error reaction. in safety-related systems, it is recommended to use
both of them in parallel.

en hel del av limitations, är den safe?
mycket dependencies. bra/dåligt?
