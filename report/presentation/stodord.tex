industry.

\section{Background}
Vehicles become more and more complex. Today there are around 80
electronic control units, running millions of lines of code needed for
brakes, infotainment systems, steering, windscreen wipers and so on.

More functionality is added every year. Things like automated parking,
night vision, traffic sign recognision will be mandatory in new cars
in the future. Cars will be connected with each other, they will be
connected with roadside management systems and also with the Internet.

vehicles are already safety critical, because you don't want to crash
because of a software failure.
