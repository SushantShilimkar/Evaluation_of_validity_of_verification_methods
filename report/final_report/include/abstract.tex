Quviq QuickCheck can be used when testing and developing software
within the automotive industry. A demonstration of QuickCheck with
functional safety in mind has been made. Ambiguities in AUTOSAR 4.0.3
were discovered. Some ISO~26262 requirements is achievable with the use
of QuickCheck, but it is not possible to achieve functional safety
using only QuickCheck. This is mainly because AUTOSAR is written in
informal syntax and can not help verify the model. Coverages has been
measured and evaluated. To reach a higher level of coverage one need
both positive and negative testing, as well as more than one
configuration.
