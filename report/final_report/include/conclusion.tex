AUTOSAR does not seem to be well fitted for functional safety due to
the informal syntax. There are no specific model to follow, and lots
of ambiguities.

ISO 26262 development cycle, the V reference model, is hard to use if
the software have not been developed for a verified system model. It
is especially hard if there exist code that is written before the
ISO-standard.

Fault injection tests on the software level seems easy to implemented
using QuickCheck. It is also easy to connect several AUTOSAR modules,
and test it with QuickCheck.

QuickCheck may be time-consuming when doing negative testing (future
work).

Measuring coverage of both C and Erlang code can be done between
QuickCheck runs by the Erlang implementation.
