Autosar don't seem to be well fitted for functional safety due to informal
syntax. There are no specific model, to follow etcetera, etcetera. Motivate
more.

The V shape: model -> code -> test -> ... Hard using AUTOSAR. Especially using
code that are written before the ISO-standard. It is a process from the
beginning.


Fault injection tests seems easy to implemented, in the software level, when having several AUTOSAR
modules written in Erlang, and tested by QuichCheck. However QuickCheck may be
time-consuming when using negative testing (future work).

Measuring coverage of C and Erlang code are done within Quickcheck runs.
