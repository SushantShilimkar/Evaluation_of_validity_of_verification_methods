\section{Requirements that is broken within AUTOSAR}
\begin{description}
  \item[ambiguous meaning] the definition of what (deadline) timestamp is and were it shall
    be set is ambiguous. Is it cycles, ticks, seconds or microseconds? and where
    should it increment/set the timestamp?
  \item[conflicting requirements] [WDGM317], [WDGM139] because [WDGM186]
  \item[no requirement, p. 125] reset of alive counter in mainfunction
  \item[ambiguous meaning] return value not specified but E\_NOT\_OK seems logical
